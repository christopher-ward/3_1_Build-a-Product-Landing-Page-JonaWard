1. On landing page, there needs to be a simple yet cinematic image of Jona at the top of the page.

2. As I scroll down, the image will move up as well, or fade-out toward the top.

3. The nav-bar should be at the top of the page always. The image from #2 will be in the middle of the nav-bar when at the very top of the screen.

4. The nav-bar will have navigation links to the home page(index.html), content/demos, about, pics from sets, and contact.

5. The links can be space around the #2 image at top or to the side of.

6. Maybe #2 image can be above the nav-bar at the beginning, and then as the page scrolls up, the image fades out toward the top. The rest of the page will continue on while the nav-bar sticks to the top.

7. All of the above can be within the header element.

8. In he next section, main, the first div will have a banner made of small thumbnails from various projects and set photos

9. A demo reel of Jona Ward will follow the banner and...

10. The video div will push the banner div "into" the header and the banner will fade behind the nav-bar.

11. Or maybe just leave the banner div below the header.
